# Unity HTTP Request Demo

**Unity HTTP Request Demo** is a beginner-friendly Unity project that demonstrates how to make HTTP requests using UnityWebRequest.
 NOTE : This demo uses the JSONPlaceHolder API. Which means it provides a read-only API. You can retreive data but cannot actually perform POST, PUT and DELETE operations.
